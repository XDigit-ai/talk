# DictAI Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 9, 2025**

## Overview

DictAI is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your voice data and transcriptions are processed locally on your device and are never sent to external servers (unless you explicitly configure cloud LLM providers).

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect
- We do not collect, store, or transmit your voice recordings
- We do not collect your transcribed text
- We do not track your usage patterns
- We do not use analytics or tracking services
- We do not share any data with third parties

### What Stays on Your Device
- All voice-to-text processing happens locally using Whisper AI
- Your transcriptions are temporarily stored in memory only during processing
- Audio recordings are automatically deleted after transcription
- Settings and preferences are stored locally on your Mac

## Optional Cloud Services

If you choose to enable Advanced Mode with cloud LLM providers:

- **Ollama**: Runs entirely on your local machine - no data leaves your device
- **Claude API**: If configured, transcribed text is sent to Anthropic's servers for enhancement. See [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- **OpenAI API**: If configured, transcribed text is sent to OpenAI's servers for enhancement. See [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)

You control which provider to use, and cloud providers are disabled by default.

## Permissions

DictAI requires the following permissions:

- **Microphone Access**: To record your voice for transcription. Audio is processed locally and immediately deleted.
- **Accessibility Access**: To paste transcribed text at your cursor position.

## Data Security

- All processing occurs on your device
- No network connections are made unless you configure cloud LLM providers
- No user accounts or authentication required

## Children's Privacy

DictAI does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.
